// Which tags belong to the brain, and which belong to the person.
//
// The distinction only becomes load-bearing when something *replaces* a
// memory's tags rather than adding to them. Until the editor grew a remove
// control, every write path unioned the new tags onto the old ones, so nothing
// could ever be lost and nothing had to be protected. A replacement can lose
// things, and the things it must not lose are the ones the Worker wrote for
// itself: the classifier's `kind:`, the contradiction pass's `status:`, the
// staleness pass's `volatility:` and `stale:`, and the pipeline's own markers.
// Those are conclusions the brain reached, not labels the user typed, and they
// are not the editor's to delete.
//
// public/utils.js draws the same line for display and for graph clustering, and
// additionally hides machine identifiers (`#5118`, `#fd540a`). That extra rule is
// deliberately absent here: hiding a junk tag costs nothing, but treating it as
// unowned would let an edit silently delete a tag that is genuinely stored.
