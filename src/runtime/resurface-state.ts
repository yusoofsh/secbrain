 * src/prompt-capsule/cache.ts keys its cache on). Same KV binding and
 * workspace-key style as src/runtime/night-summary.ts.
 *
 * `day` and `shownId` give same-day stability: the pick does not change on a
 * second app open the same day. `recent` is the rolling memory of what was
 * shown, so tomorrow's pick does not repeat this week's; `dismissed` is what
 * the member explicitly said "not this one" to, and never comes back — except
 * at the degenerate end of src/routes/brief.ts's dynamic bound-parameter
 * budget (pickResurface), where a caller whose OWN scope is wide enough (many
 * company workspaces) can leave zero room for exclusions at all. `dismissed`
 * gets first claim on whatever room there is, ahead of `recent`, so that is
 * the last guarantee to give way, not the first.
