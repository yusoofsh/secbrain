/**
 * GET /brief — what the brain did while you were away.
 *
 * The dashboard used to open on an empty screen with a text box, on a brain
 * holding thousands of memories that four nightly jobs had spent the night
 * compressing, linking and judging. Everything below is already-produced work
 * being read back; nothing here computes, embeds, or calls a model.
 *
 * BUDGET. Six to eight D1 queries plus one KV read and at most one KV write,
 * no AI, no Vectorize, one HTTP round trip. Six queries run in parallel
 * (sources, patterns, activity, topics, the attention+loops+due aggregate,
 * the loops preview — Task A added the loops preview, folding its count into
 * the aggregate for free and paying one query for its three preview rows;
 * Task H's `due` count is a second free CASE/SUM on that same aggregate). The
 * resurface pick runs AFTER that batch, as a separate 1-2 query step,
 * because Task B's topic preference needs the topics query's own result —
 * it cannot join the parallel batch it depends on. It costs one query when
 * there is no topic preference to test (a quiet week) or the pick is already
 * settled for today (KV's same-day fetch-by-id); two when a fresh pick has
 * topics to prefer (a count probe, then the pick itself). The KV read/write
 * are resurface v2's seen/dismissed state (src/runtime/resurface-state.ts) —
 * one read always, one write only when today's pick is new and this is not
 * a `?preview=1` request, so a preview deployment can be polled repeatedly
 * without disturbing production's rotation.
 *
 * Against this codebase's self-imposed ~50-call D1 budget per invocation
 * (the platform's real ceiling is 1,000), and against the free plan's 10 ms
 * CPU limit charged once per round trip: the alternative is the client
 * asking six-plus endpoints instead of one, which loses on both. Each query
 * is either indexed (created_at DESC) or bounded by a small LIMIT. The count
 * is pinned by test/integration/brief-budget.test.ts, and that pin is the
 * point: this endpoint is the one thing every user runs every time.

 * Fresh resurface pick: prefer a candidate sharing one of this week's top

 * subset is empty (no topics this week, or none of the candidates carry one).
 *
 * Costs one D1 query when there is nothing to prefer (skips straight to the
 * fallback pool) or two when there is: a COUNT probe to test whether the
 * preferred subset has anything at all, then the pick itself against
 * whichever pool the probe selected. The pick query keeps the OFFSET-wraps-
 * inside-SQL trick from v1: the filter clause is bound twice, once for the
 * row and once for the count it wraps against, so a brain with fewer
 * candidates than the rotation constant never silently shows nothing.
 *
 * BOUND-PARAMETER BUDGET. That doubling is exactly what makes this query's
 * size someone else's decision, not this function's: it binds
 * RESURFACE_FILTER (2) + up to 6 topic patterns + up to
 * RESURFACE_EXCLUDE_BOUND_CAP exclusion ids + scope.bindings — TWICE — plus
 * one placeholder for `today`. scope.bindings is not a small constant, it is
 * personal plus every company workspace the caller belongs to (readableWorkspaces,
 * src/lib/scope.ts), unbounded in principle and ~32 real teams for an admin
 * today (see the /stats/graph comment in admin.ts making the same point). A
 * fixed exclusion cap plus that scope size overflowed D1's 100-bound-parameter
 * ceiling — this function has no try/catch, so the overflow 500'd the WHOLE
 * GET /brief response, every field, not just the pick.
 *
 * Solving `2 * (2 + topicN + excludedN + scopeN) + 1 <= D1_MAX_BOUND_PARAMS`
 * for the combined topicN + excludedN slack once scopeN is known gives the
 * budget below. Mirrors POST /patterns/resolve's per-request bulkLimit
 * (admin.ts), generalized to a statement that binds its scope clause twice.
 *
 * Correctness outranks relevance when the two compete for that budget: the
 * exclusion list (a dismissed or just-shown id must not come back) claims it
 * first, up to RESURFACE_EXCLUDE_BOUND_CAP; topic preference (a nicety) only
 * survives in whatever room is left, and is dropped OUTRIGHT rather than
 * partially — a topic clause missing some of this week's tags would silently
 * bias toward whichever happened to fit, which is worse than no preference at
 * all. At zero budget (an admin in enough company workspaces on their own),
 * both drop to nothing and this degrades to a v1-style unfiltered pick:
 * RESURFACE_FILTER and scope alone, still safe because THAT doubled shape
 * costs `2 * (2 + scopeN) + 1`, comfortably under the ceiling until scopeN
 * itself exceeds roughly 47 — a pre-existing v1 shape this fix does not
 * change, since scope.clause cannot be dropped without breaking isolation.
