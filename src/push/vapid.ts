/**
 * One VAPID (RFC 8292) P-256 key pair for the whole deployment, generated on
 * first need and stored in the night-summary KV namespace (OAUTH_KV) as JWK —
 * NOT per workspace. Self-hosted zero-config is the point: there is nothing
 * to configure, and every subscriber shares one application-server identity.
 * The private key lives in KV in the clear, the same trust boundary this
 * Worker already gives AUTH_TOKEN and every OAuth secret.
 *
 * The same key pair also serves as the RFC 8291 message-encryption ECDH key
 * (src/push/crypto.ts) — see that module's comment for why reusing one static
 * key across subscribers and messages is an accepted simplification.
