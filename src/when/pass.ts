/**
 * Nightly capped AI extraction: for entries the free regex pass
 * (src/when/heuristic.ts) could not anchor, ask the model whether this reads
 * as a commitment and, if so, when it is due.
 *
 * Budgeted hard, like every nightly pass sharing one scheduled() invocation:
 * at most WHEN_EXTRACT_PER_NIGHT model calls and, regardless of how many of
 * those are commitments, exactly one SELECT plus at most one batched UPDATE —
 * two D1 statements, well inside the ten this pass is held to.
 *
 * The cursor is a KV keyset over (created_at, id), mirroring
 * src/insight/candidates.ts's ACCRUAL_CURSOR_KEY: cheap, and immune to a tie
 * group of same-millisecond captures being split across nights.
 *
 * Robustness contract mirrors src/insight/reason.ts: "declined" (the model
 * gave a real answer and it was not a due commitment) and "failed" (the call
 * itself produced nothing to judge) are different outcomes. A declined
 * candidate has been looked at and the cursor may pass it; a failed one has
 * not, and the pass stops there rather than risk skipping it — the whole
 * point of a keyset cursor is that nothing between the old position and the
 * new one is silently missed.
 *
 * Two failure modes this contract has to survive, found in review:
 *
 *   - The persisted write itself can fail (env.DB.batch rejects). If the
 *     cursor had already advanced past the judged candidates by then, a
 *     correctly-judged commitment is lost forever — the row stays
 *     when_at IS NULL, but the cursor says this entry was already handled,
 *     so nothing ever asks about it again. So the cursor advance and the
 *     batch write are one unit: nothing about this run's position is
 *     persisted unless the write actually landed. A rolled-back run
 *     re-judges the same window next time, declines included, which is a
 *     fresh model call for at most WHEN_EXTRACT_PER_NIGHT candidates the
 *     following night — inside the nightly budget it was already
 *     accepting.
 *
 *   - A single entry can fail every night forever (a permanent model
 *     refusal, or content the model can never parse). Because a "failed"
 *     outcome never advances the cursor, that entry is always candidate #1
 *     again the next night, the pass stops on it every time, and every
 *     candidate behind it in the corpus is never reached — proven wedged
 *     across five simulated nights in review. The cursor's KV value
 *     therefore also tracks `failedId`/`failCount`: three consecutive
 *     nights failing on the SAME id quarantines it — the cursor advances
 *     past that one entry, the counter resets, and it is counted in
 *     `whenSkipped` rather than retried forever. Two consecutive failures
 *     still behave exactly as before (stop, no advance): the bar is three,
 *     not one, so a single bad night for an otherwise-fine entry is not
 *     mistaken for a permanent block.

Does this describe something the person needs to DO by a specific point in time — a deadline, a task with a due date, an appointment, a commitment they made? A general fact, a preference, or something that already happened with no future action is not a commitment.

If it is a commitment, say what needs to be done in a few words, written as an instruction, at most 120 characters. Give the date it is due as an absolute date (YYYY-MM-DD), resolving any relative phrase ("next Friday", "in two weeks") against ${today} as today. If you cannot pin down a specific date, this is not a commitment for this purpose.

Also say what KIND of moment this is: "event" when it is something happening AT that time — an appointment, a meeting, a trip — rather than a deadline to finish something BY that time, which is "due".
