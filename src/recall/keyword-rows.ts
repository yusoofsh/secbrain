/**
 * Ids first, text last. The keyword arm used to read every candidate note in full (up to KEYWORD_CANDIDATE_LIMIT of them, tens of
 * KB each) so the Worker could weigh each query term in it, and the Worker paid CPU to parse and scan those bytes. D1 does that
 * work now: each candidate row comes back with, per term, one number, and no text.
 *
 *   0  the term is not in the note
 *   1  it is, but only inside longer words ("cat" in "concatenate")
 *   2  it is, standing as a word of its own
 *
 * "Standing as a word" is the fusion's boundary rule, `(?<![\w])term(?![\w])`: the characters either side are not [A-Za-z0-9_].
 * The rule is decided on the first two occurrences of the term: a note whose first two are inside longer words and whose third is
 * a word of its own reads as 1 here and 2 in the old scan (an accepted approximation for ASCII terms).
 *
 * SQLite's lower() folds ASCII only (as LIKE does), so a term with other characters ("café", "москва") cannot be decided in SQL.
 * The SQL searches the ASCII-lowered text for the lowercased term, and a level of 2 from that is exact (the occurrence is made of
 * characters lowercase leaves alone). Any level below 2 for such a term is settled by `settleWideTerms`, which reads the text of
 * just those rows by id and applies the old scan's rule (Unicode toLowerCase, the boundary above) in the Worker. A query with
 * only ASCII terms never reads text.
