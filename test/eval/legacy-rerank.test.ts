/*
 * The frozen root-quality benchmarks pin the reranker off, because their mock AI cannot rank passages. The reranker
 * rescales the root view that feeds selectGraphRoots, so these run the same 20 real-SQL cases with it ON and hold
 * graph-root QUALITY (seeds, answers, fusion survival, authority-rank regressions) to the original frozen gates.
 * Only the AI-call gate changes, by exactly the one reranker call per applied recall.
 *   1. a model that agrees with the heuristic order: the blend plumbing (direct and root rescale, the scored-block
 *      lift) must not disturb root selection, so every frozen gate holds;
 *   2. opt-in (EVAL_LOCAL_MODELS=1): the real pinned bge-reranker-base, which is the quality evidence.
