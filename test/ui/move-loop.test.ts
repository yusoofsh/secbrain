/**
 * #347's pure drain loop for the "move already-synced memories" action,
 * following restore-loop.test.ts's pattern — the only existing multi-call
 * drain test in test/ui/ (see docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-347-ui-contract.md
 * §7.1, which names this file's absence explicitly and gives this exact
 * skeleton as the thing to write).
 *
 * Contract this test pins for the implementer (not specified by the plan, so
 * fixed here — see the test-author's final report for the full list):
 *   - a function `runMoveLoop(provider, post, onProgress)` is a module-level
 *     global in public/js/integrations.js, extracted the same way
 *     `runImportLoop` is extracted in public/js/settings.js;
 *   - `post` is `(cursor) => Promise<{ moved, alreadyThere, missing, refused, remaining, cursor }>`,
 *     called with `undefined` on the first call and the previous response's
 *     `cursor` afterwards, until `cursor` is falsy;
 *   - `onProgress({ done, total })` fires after every page, `done` being the
 *     cumulative moved+alreadyThere+missing+refused so far;
 *   - `runMoveLoop` resolves `{ moved, alreadyThere, missing, refused }` totals
 *     on a full drain;
 *   - on a page rejecting, `runMoveLoop` rejects too (propagates, following
 *     runImportLoop's own precedent), but the rejection's Error carries a
 *     `.partial` property with the totals accumulated before the failure, so
 *     the caller can report "N moved so far, stopped, safe to resume" instead
 *     of losing that count the way syncIntegration's plain throw does today;
 *   - a batch making zero progress while remaining stays positive is treated
 *     as a stall and rejects with a message matching /stalled|did not advance/i,
 *     the same "fail loudly, don't spin" contract runImportLoop already has.
